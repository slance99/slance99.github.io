    "text": "1.1 Introduction ✵\nA watershed management plan is a strategic guide designed to protect and sustainably manage water resources, as well as address the interconnected environmental, social, and economic factors that impact a watershed. This plan aims to provide a comprehensive framework for preserving and enhancing water quality, flood resilience, and ecological health for the Cahokia-Joaquim Watershed, located on the border of eastern Missouri and western Illinois and encompassing the city of St. Louis, MO. Effective water management in the Cahokia-Joaqim watershed is especially critical because its waters drain directly into the Mississippi River. The health of this watershed directly affects not only local water quality and flood management, but also the condition of the Mississippi River and the ecosystems and communities downstream. This impact extends as far as the Gulf of Mexico, where excess nutrients carried by the Mississippi River contribute to a large hypoxic zone that threatens marine life and fisheries. The recommendations included in this management plan are based on the most up-to-date scientific and economic assessments available."

The periodic flooding of these rivers historically contributed to the enrichment of the soil, facilitating the prosperity of Cahokia, one of the largest Native American settlements in North America (Snoflo, 2024). Currently, St. Louis serves as the largest urban center within the watershed, with a metropolitan population exceeding 2.8 million (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020).\n\n\nFigure 1.1.

    "text": "1.5 Geology ✵\nAlluvial deposits from the Mississippi dominate the shallow watershed in the Northern Missouri side of the watershed (Figure 1.4). These soils are incredibly fertile and allowed for the development of one of the most advanced native settlements in the United States, Cahokia (Snoflo, 2024). In Illinois, the surface geology is composed of alluvial deposits and materials from the most recent glaciation, the Wisconsin Episode (Illinois State Geologic Survey, 2001). Moving south along the Mississippi, where more geology is exposed, the extensive carbonate and silicate deposits of Missouri and Illinois become apparent (Figure 1.5). These were deposited during the Paleozoic Era between 542 and 251 million years ago, when Missouri experienced drastic sea-level changes (Washington University in St. Louis, 2020). This led to the physical deposition of rock, such as shales and sandstones, and the chemical deposition of limestones and dolomites. \n\n\nOne of Missouri and Illinois’s most prominent geologic resources is galena, formed through significant faulting in the region (Washington University in St. Louis, 2020). Since the early 1700s, Missouri has mined galena, otherwise known as lead sulfide. Galena is also found in Northwestern Illinois, with a small town aptly named Galena becoming a hub of lead mining in the United States (Illinois Museum of Natural History, n.d.). Galena is often found in rocks deposited during the Pennsylvanian Era and is primarily used to create lead-acid batteries (Missouri Secretary of State, n.d.). Currently, Missouri is the leading smelter of lead in the United States and the second-largest lead smelting district in the world (Missouri Department of Natural Resources, 2021). The Meramec River, a tributary of the Mississippi within the watershed, runs through this lead mining area and has experienced significant lead contamination (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, n.d.). \n\nFigure 1.4.

    "text": "1.6 Soil Characteristics\nSoil permeability along the Mississippi River is fairly low (Figure 1.7) due to the presence of silty clay and silty clay loam alongside the river (Figure 1.10). Soil along the western side of the river is more susceptible to erosion than along the eastern side (Figure 1.8). However, areas even further east from the river are also highly erodible, similar to the western portion (Figure 1.8). Many areas along the riverbed have low to very low infiltration rates (Figure 1.9). These soil characteristics indicate there may be a high risk of flooding and large volumes of runoff within the watershed during precipitation events, and corresponding risks of erosion and sediment transport. \n\nFigure 1.7. Soil permeability in the Cahokia-Joaquim Watershed. Permeability is measured by soil saturated hydraulic connectivity (Ksat). Lower permeability soils are shown in darker blue, while higher permeability soils are shown in lighter blue. Gray areas within the watershed boundary lack adequate data.\n\nFigure 1.8. Soil erodibility in the Cahokia-Joaquim Watershed. Erodibility is quantified by the whole soil erodibility factor (Kw). More easily erodible soils are shown in brown (larger Kw), while less erodible soils are shown in green (smaller Kw). Gray areas within the watershed boundary lack adequate data.\n\nFigure 1.9. Soil hydrologic groups in the Cahokia-Joaquim watershed. Groups range from A (high infiltration, low runoff potential) to D (low infiltration, high runoff potential). Groups B/D and C/D have a very low infiltration rate and high runoff potential under natural conditions, but would have higher rates of infiltration if drained. Each group is visualized with a unique color on the map. Gray areas within the watershed boundary lack adequate data or are too highly modified from the original state to be mapped to these hydrologic groupings.\n\nFigure 1.10.

    "text": "1.7 Hydrology ✵\nThe Cahokia-Joaquim watershed is composed of hundreds of small tributaries leading into the Mississippi. One of the major tributaries is the Missouri River, the longest river in the United States, with a length of 2,540 miles (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). Its headwaters are in Montana and drains over 529,000 square miles into the Mississippi River just North of St. Louis. Compared to the Mississippi, the Missouri River has almost three times the amount of suspended sediment, making it much more turbid (Umar et.al, 2018).\n\nThe Meramec River begins South of St. Louis in Salem, Missouri, and flows freely for 218 linear miles to its confluence with the Mississippi. While the Army Corps of Engineers attempted to erect a dam on the river in the early 1970s, the local chapter of the Sierra Club successfully fought off damming attempts (Jackson et al., 1984). The watershed surrounding the Meramec drains over 2,149 square miles (Blanc et al., 1998). This river is also impacted by mining in the Old Lead Belt, where significant storm events mobilize heavy metals, causing the Meramec to mobilize up to 27.2 tons of lead and 14.5 tons of zinc (Markland and Buckley, 2024). \n\nFigure 1.11.

    "text": "1.9 Biological Assets\nThe Cahokia-Joachim Watershed provides habitat for hundreds of species of aquatic invertebrates, fish, migratory birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, and plants. Historically, the watershed comprised old-growth forests, woodlands, tall grass prairies, and wetlands that supported a variety of wildlife (Missouri Department of Conservation, n.d.). Today, the watershed is largely urbanized, and one of the primary waterways in St. Louis— the River des Peres— is channelized, partially buried, and used for sewage and stormwater runoff (The Cultural Landscapes Foundation, n.d.). As a result, wildlife is negatively impacted by water quality degradation and by loss of habitat. Migrating birds, such as the American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), Bachman’s sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis), and Northern Harrier (Circus hudsonius) rely on the ecosystem habitats in the Cahokia-Joachim watershed for nesting and hunting (Missouri Department of Conservation, n.d.). The health and size of the birds’ prey populations, especially amphibians, depend on the sufficient flow and quality of freshwater in the system (Tualatin Soil and Water Conservation District, 2021).\nSeveral species declared endangered by either the federal government or the states of Missouri and Illinois are found in the Cahokia-Joachim watershed. This includes six species of aquatic invertebrates: Ebonyshell (Fusconaia ebena), Elephantear (Elliptio crassidens), Pink Mucket (Lampsilis abrupta), Scaleshell (Leptodea leptodon),  Sheepnose/Bullhead (Plethobasus cyphyus), and Snuffbox (Epioblasma triquetra). Aquatic invertebrates are useful indicators of stream quality because many species are sensitive to water pollution and may exhibit the first observable population decline in response to degraded water quality. The watershed is also home to the endangered mammals, the Gray bat (Myotis grisescens) and Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis); endangered amphibians and reptiles, Blanding’s Turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) and Eastern Hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis); and the endangered Pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) (Missouri Department of Conservation, n.d.).\n\n\nTable 1.2.

    "text": "1.10 Summary\nLocated in the Rust Belt, the Cahokia-Joaquim watershed has been shaped by nearly 150 years of industrialization and human activity, impacting its soils, land use, and ecological integrity. The fertile soils– historically enriched by periodic flooding of the Mississippi River– have been utilized for agriculture. However, their low permeability and high susceptibility to erosion have increased runoff and flood risk, has exacerbated sediment transport into water bodies. Lead extraction and smelting, which have historically capitalized on the region’s rich geologic deposits, particularly galena, have left a legacy of heavy metal contamination in local waterways, such as the Meramec River. Urbanization, concentrated around St. Louis, has replaced vast stretches of native forests, wetlands, and grasslands, reducing habitat availability for wildlife and further contributing to degraded water quality through channelization and stormwater runoff. These impacts have likely had cascading effects on the watershed’s biodiversity, particularly on sensitive or endangered species. Furthermore, the watershed’s role as a critical drainage area into the Mississippi River underscores its broader significance, as it affects downstream ecosystems, including the Gulf of Mexico’s hypoxic zone."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nFrom 1900-2022, atmospheric carbon has climbed from 8.54 to 53.85 billion tons (Jones et al. 2024). While we can model previous carbon emissions, predicting future emissions regimes, alongside societal change and economic development, divides scholars. Each possible scenario, which ranges from overly pessimistic (high difficulty mitigating emissions) to overly optimistic (low difficulty mitigating emissions), will affect species to varying degrees. \n\n\nProblem\nClimate change and socioeconomic development will affect future environmental conditions and African lion range. We sought to understand the distribution of future suitable habitat for lions, considering two climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) to encompass a range of possible future conditions.\n\n\nApproach \nTo understand this problem, we utilized Maxent through the interactive web interface Wallace. Maxent utilizes species occurrence data input by the user as well as climate data (precipitation, temperature, etc.) to find the current range of suitable habitats for a specific species. It then allows the user to input a desired future timeframe and climate scenario to visualize changes in range over time. For this project, all other variables were held constant except the climate scenario (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) to compare the differences in suitable habitat accurately. Once the analysis was performed for each scenario, the original and future maps were exported as TIF files and input into ArcGIS Pro. Using Raster Calculator, the values of the future map were subtracted from the original to yield a layer describing the change in habitat suitability between the two. \n\n\nResults \nThe final analysis produced two maps (Figure 1) showing the percentage change for African Lion habitats between the two climate scenarios. Visual assessment provided the following results:\n\nWestern Africa was more suitable for African lions in SSP1-2.6 compared to SSP5-8.5\nSouthern Africa was more suitable for African Lions in SSP5-8.5 compared to SSP1-2.6\nRegions in Central Africa that became more suitable for African Lions in SSP1-2.6 became less suitable for lions in SSP5-8.5\n\n\nFigure 1. African lion habitat suitability. Percent change in habitat suitability for African lions (Panthera leo) from present day to 2041-60 under SSP1-2.6 (A-Sam Lance) and SSP5-8.5 (B-Liv Hemond).\n\n\nConclusion \nThe areas characterized by a negative change in habitat suitability values, shown in dark green on the map, should be prioritized for conservation. In effect, these areas are predicted to become increasingly suitable for lions in the future (henceforth these areas are referred to as “future suitable habitat”). It would be useful to compare the locations of future suitable habitat with existing nature reserves and protected areas to assess what degree of protection is already given to them, and whether there are key areas missing that would benefit from greater protections. Given the uncertainty over which SSP scenario will best match reality, managers may also want to prioritize conservation of future suitable habitat, especially where the areas overlap between the two SSP scenarios. \nIf lions shift their ranges to occupy new areas, it is worth considering the impact that may have on people living in those areas, especially if they are not accustomed to living near lions. While a charismatic and widely-regarded species, lions are also potentially dangerous to livestock and humans (Mills et al., 2023). To minimize human-wildlife conflict in a changing world, wildlife managers may want to consider proactively planning for human-lion coexistence in those communities based upon existing successful strategies (Blackburn et al., 2016)."
