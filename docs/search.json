    "section": "",
    "text": "Background:\nAs a keystone species, jaguars (Panthera onca) regulate trophic dynamics of tropical rainforests in Central America. According to the 2016 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, P. onca is classified as near threatened after losing 50% of its historic range with population size continuing to decline over time (Quigley et al., 2017; Sanderson et al., 2002).\n\n\n\nProblem:\nHabitat loss and fragmentation associated with agricultural and urban expansion have contributed to P. onca population decline. In Southern Costa Rica, fragmentation led to the creation of two disconnected populations in the region, which reduces population viability and threatens P. onca persistence. Therefore, it is critical to identify opportunities to remove barriers to movement between core habitats and enhance connectivity.\n\n\nApproach:\nWe used Circuitscape to identify the least-cost path and barriers to P. onca movement between three core habitats in Southern Costa Rica. To identify the least-cost path, we used Linkage Mapper to build a network and map linkages using the core areas and a resistance layer created by Folger and Brock. The resistance layer includes surface features such as roads, elevation, and land cover that can influence species movement and landscape connectivity. Barriers to movement were determined using the Barrier Mapper tool within Linkage Mapper set a detection radius of 1000m. Barrier Mapper identifies critical connectivity barriers and reveals the value (benefit) of barrier removal to improve connectivity. In our analysis, we reclassified values greater than 0.75 in the barrier raster to represent opportunities where the value and benefit of barrier removal are high. To facilitate our understanding of broader land use influence on connectivity, we reclassified specific land use categories to four bins: agriculture, natural areas, urban, and water. Agriculture includes coffee, teak, palm, and pineapple plantations, as well as pasture. Natural areas include forests, mangroves, natural palm forests, paramos, and wetlands. \n\n\nResults:\nThe least-cost path connecting P. onca core habitat in Corcovado, Piedras Blancas, La Amisted National Parks primarily crosses natural areas and avoids agricultural land (Fig 1,2). Within natural areas, P. onca preferably navigates through primary and secondary forests. Connectivity barriers occur where agriculture intersects with the least cost path (Fig 1,2). \n\n\nConclusions:\nOur analysis revealed barriers along the least-cost path that would be most beneficial to improve habitat connectivity between core P. onca habitat. These areas are not exclusively natural forest, however, and include agricultural parcels that would be difficult to remove. Land owners could oppose the project, as a one time payment for their land would deprive them of the longer term income they could have from continuously farming. Easements or payments for ecosystem services could alleviate this problem, however, as farmers could allot a certain amount of their plot to fallow and become forest while still actively farming.\nIf land purchases or easements could be acquired, the soil and vegetation in these lands are likely heavily degraded due to extensive agriculture. This would require some degree of restoration to make the habitat more navigable for P. onca. The costs of a project like this would be incredibly high, and would likely need to be fronted by outside agencies like the Nature Conservancy or the World Wildlife Fund. Additionally, local groups could oppose the movement of P. onca near their land. Although they are keystone species whose protection could ensure greater regional conservation, they are dangerous animals that have the potential to harm humans and cattle. \n\nFigure 1. Exploring Barriers to Panthera onca Movement in Costa Rica. Connectivity barriers were identified along the least-cost path of P. onca movement between the two western core habitat in Southern Costa Rica. Dark orange polygons indicate areas where barrier removal is highly beneficial to connectivity, while light orange indicates where removal is less beneficial (Priscilla Ta).\n\nFigure 2. Relative benefits of restoring areas in Costa Rica. Barriers to connectivity between the La Amisted and Piedras Blancas National Parks. Light and dark grey patches indicate the presence of agricultural and natural lands in these barrier areas. The positive impact of removing these barriers is greater the closer to the least cost path (dotted line), and lower the further away (Sam Lance).\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nQuigley, H., Foster, R., Petracca, L., Payan, E., Salom, R., & Harmsen, B.

    "text": "1.1 Introduction ✵\nA watershed management plan is a strategic guide designed to protect and sustainably manage water resources, as well as address the interconnected environmental, social, and economic factors that impact a watershed. This plan aims to provide a comprehensive framework for preserving and enhancing water quality, flood resilience, and ecological health for the Cahokia-Joaquim Watershed, located on the border of eastern Missouri and western Illinois and encompassing the city of St. Louis, MO. Effective water management in the Cahokia-Joaqim watershed is especially critical because its waters drain directly into the Mississippi River. The health of this watershed directly affects not only local water quality and flood management, but also the condition of the Mississippi River and the ecosystems and communities downstream. This impact extends as far as the Gulf of Mexico, where excess nutrients carried by the Mississippi River contribute to a large hypoxic zone that threatens marine life and fisheries. The recommendations included in this management plan are based on the most up-to-date scientific and economic assessments available."

    "text": "1.5 Geology ✵\nAlluvial deposits from the Mississippi dominate the shallow watershed in the Northern Missouri side of the watershed (Figure 1.4). These soils are incredibly fertile and allowed for the development of one of the most advanced native settlements in the United States, Cahokia (Snoflo, 2024). In Illinois, the surface geology is composed of alluvial deposits and materials from the most recent glaciation, the Wisconsin Episode (Illinois State Geologic Survey, 2001). Moving south along the Mississippi, where more geology is exposed, the extensive carbonate and silicate deposits of Missouri and Illinois become apparent (Figure 1.5). These were deposited during the Paleozoic Era between 542 and 251 million years ago, when Missouri experienced drastic sea-level changes (Washington University in St. Louis, 2020). This led to the physical deposition of rock, such as shales and sandstones, and the chemical deposition of limestones and dolomites. \n\n\nOne of Missouri and Illinois’s most prominent geologic resources is galena, formed through significant faulting in the region (Washington University in St. Louis, 2020). Since the early 1700s, Missouri has mined galena, otherwise known as lead sulfide. Galena is also found in Northwestern Illinois, with a small town aptly named Galena becoming a hub of lead mining in the United States (Illinois Museum of Natural History, n.d.). Galena is often found in rocks deposited during the Pennsylvanian Era and is primarily used to create lead-acid batteries (Missouri Secretary of State, n.d.). Currently, Missouri is the leading smelter of lead in the United States and the second-largest lead smelting district in the world (Missouri Department of Natural Resources, 2021). The Meramec River, a tributary of the Mississippi within the watershed, runs through this lead mining area and has experienced significant lead contamination (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, n.d.). \n\nFigure 1.4.

    "text": "1.6 Soil Characteristics\nSoil permeability along the Mississippi River is fairly low (Figure 1.7) due to the presence of silty clay and silty clay loam alongside the river (Figure 1.10). Soil along the western side of the river is more susceptible to erosion than along the eastern side (Figure 1.8). However, areas even further east from the river are also highly erodible, similar to the western portion (Figure 1.8). Many areas along the riverbed have low to very low infiltration rates (Figure 1.9). These soil characteristics indicate there may be a high risk of flooding and large volumes of runoff within the watershed during precipitation events, and corresponding risks of erosion and sediment transport. \n\nFigure 1.7.

    "text": "1.7 Hydrology ✵\nThe Cahokia-Joaquim watershed is composed of hundreds of small tributaries leading into the Mississippi. One of the major tributaries is the Missouri River, the longest river in the United States, with a length of 2,540 miles (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). Its headwaters are in Montana and drains over 529,000 square miles into the Mississippi River just North of St. Louis. Compared to the Mississippi, the Missouri River has almost three times the amount of suspended sediment, making it much more turbid (Umar et.al, 2018).\n\nThe Meramec River begins South of St. Louis in Salem, Missouri, and flows freely for 218 linear miles to its confluence with the Mississippi. While the Army Corps of Engineers attempted to erect a dam on the river in the early 1970s, the local chapter of the Sierra Club successfully fought off damming attempts (Jackson et al., 1984). The watershed surrounding the Meramec drains over 2,149 square miles (Blanc et al., 1998). This river is also impacted by mining in the Old Lead Belt, where significant storm events mobilize heavy metals, causing the Meramec to mobilize up to 27.2 tons of lead and 14.5 tons of zinc (Markland and Buckley, 2024). \n\nFigure 1.11.

    "text": "1.9 Biological Assets\nThe Cahokia-Joachim Watershed provides habitat for hundreds of species of aquatic invertebrates, fish, migratory birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, and plants. Historically, the watershed comprised old-growth forests, woodlands, tall grass prairies, and wetlands that supported a variety of wildlife (Missouri Department of Conservation, n.d.). Today, the watershed is largely urbanized, and one of the primary waterways in St. Louis— the River des Peres— is channelized, partially buried, and used for sewage and stormwater runoff (The Cultural Landscapes Foundation, n.d.). As a result, wildlife is negatively impacted by water quality degradation and by loss of habitat. Migrating birds, such as the American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), Bachman’s sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis), and Northern Harrier (Circus hudsonius) rely on the ecosystem habitats in the Cahokia-Joachim watershed for nesting and hunting (Missouri Department of Conservation, n.d.). The health and size of the birds’ prey populations, especially amphibians, depend on the sufficient flow and quality of freshwater in the system (Tualatin Soil and Water Conservation District, 2021).\nSeveral species declared endangered by either the federal government or the states of Missouri and Illinois are found in the Cahokia-Joachim watershed. This includes six species of aquatic invertebrates: Ebonyshell (Fusconaia ebena), Elephantear (Elliptio crassidens), Pink Mucket (Lampsilis abrupta), Scaleshell (Leptodea leptodon),  Sheepnose/Bullhead (Plethobasus cyphyus), and Snuffbox (Epioblasma triquetra). Aquatic invertebrates are useful indicators of stream quality because many species are sensitive to water pollution and may exhibit the first observable population decline in response to degraded water quality. The watershed is also home to the endangered mammals, the Gray bat (Myotis grisescens) and Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis); endangered amphibians and reptiles, Blanding’s Turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) and Eastern Hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis); and the endangered Pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) (Missouri Department of Conservation, n.d.).\n\n\nTable 1.2.

    "text": "1.10 Summary\nLocated in the Rust Belt, the Cahokia-Joaquim watershed has been shaped by nearly 150 years of industrialization and human activity, impacting its soils, land use, and ecological integrity. The fertile soils– historically enriched by periodic flooding of the Mississippi River– have been utilized for agriculture. However, their low permeability and high susceptibility to erosion have increased runoff and flood risk, has exacerbated sediment transport into water bodies. Lead extraction and smelting, which have historically capitalized on the region’s rich geologic deposits, particularly galena, have left a legacy of heavy metal contamination in local waterways, such as the Meramec River. Urbanization, concentrated around St. Louis, has replaced vast stretches of native forests, wetlands, and grasslands, reducing habitat availability for wildlife and further contributing to degraded water quality through channelization and stormwater runoff. These impacts have likely had cascading effects on the watershed’s biodiversity, particularly on sensitive or endangered species. Furthermore, the watershed’s role as a critical drainage area into the Mississippi River underscores its broader significance, as it affects downstream ecosystems, including the Gulf of Mexico’s hypoxic zone."

    "text": "1 The Personal Motivations\nAs a geologist turned geomorphologist, my academic interests generally return to the abiotic factors in our world. I have always been interested in volcanoes and their relationship to the movement of Earth’s tectonic plates, but have never had the opportunity to learn more outside of my introductory geology courses.\nAs I was looking for an interesting dataset to create an infographic about, I discovered the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History’s Global Volcanism Program’s dataset. Detailing all known volcanic eruptions from the last 12,000 years, it provided the perfect opportunity for me to learn more about volcanoes and practice my skills in R.\nAfter looking into the data more closely, I realized it showed very clear trends that specific types of volcanoes, composite volcanoes, were clustered around the Pacific Ocean. This creates the famous Ring of Fire, formed due to the unique tectonic setting of the region, which naturally produces large, incredibly destructive volcanoes. While many people learn about volcanoes in middle school science courses, many do not know the mechanisms behind their formation. This infographic is meant to provide an opportunity to re-up that knowledge, and learn a bit more about composite volcanoes and how they are linked to the Ring of Fire.\n\n\n\nSam Sitting on a Rock on a Geology Field Trip to Lone Pine"

All dates in the dataset were written as “2000 BCE”, which needed to be converted into a numeric to be used in any analysis. Additionally, for this analysis I only wanted to look at eruptions with a confirmed eruption date after 0 CE, so I filtered out all eruptions with an eruption date of “unknown”.\n\n\nCode\n#| echo: true\n#| message: false\n\nvolcano_og &lt;- read.csv(here(\"posts\", \"2025-03-09-data-vis-infographic\", \"data\", \"volcano_list.csv\"))\nvolcano_pop_og &lt;- read.csv(here(\"posts\", \"2025-03-09-data-vis-infographic\", \"data\", \"volcano_pop.csv\"))\n\nvolcano_mod &lt;- volcano_og |&gt;\n  clean_names() |&gt;\n  filter(last_known_eruption != \"Unknown\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    eruption_year = case_when(\n      grepl(\"BCE\", last_known_eruption) ~ -as.numeric(gsub(\" BCE\", \"\", last_known_eruption)),\n      grepl(\"CE\", last_known_eruption)  ~ as.numeric(gsub(\" CE\", \"\", last_known_eruption)),\n      TRUE ~ as.numeric(last_known_eruption))) |&gt;\n  arrange(eruption_year) |&gt;\n  filter(eruption_year &gt; 0)\n\n#CREATING MAP OF VOLCANOES\nworld &lt;- ne_download(scale = 110, type = \"countries\", category = \"cultural\")\n\n\nReading layer `ne_110m_admin_0_countries' from data source \n  `/private/var/folders/7r/2ngr651x2rd0q43kgmpyvwvw0000gn/T/RtmpzQjbVG/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 177 features and 168 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -180 ymin: -90 xmax: 180 ymax: 83.64513\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Map of Composite Volcanoes\nThis figure is meant to answer the first question of the three: where are composite volcanoes located around the world? The map shows the location of all composite volcanoes in the dataset, with the color of the point representing the tectonic setting of the volcano. The map is centered on the Pacific Ocean, with the Ring of Fire clearly visible. This allows the viewer to see the clustering of composite volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nCode\n#| echo: true\n#| message: false\n#| \n#FILTERING COMPOSITE VOLCANOES\ncomposite_volcanoes &lt;- volcano_mod |&gt;\n  filter(volcano_landform == \"Composite\") \n\ncomposite_volcanoes_sum &lt;- volcano_mod |&gt;\n  filter(volcano_landform == \"Composite\") |&gt;\n  group_by(tectonic_setting) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n())\n\nother_volcanoes &lt;- volcano_mod |&gt;\n  filter(volcano_landform != \"Composite\")\n\nvolcano_map &lt;- ggplot(data = world) +\n  geom_sf(fill = v_grey, color = v_grey) +\n  geom_point(data = composite_volcanoes, \n             aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = dorange), \n             size = 1.25) +\n  scale_color_identity() +  # Use scale_color_identity to preserve the colors specified\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = NULL,\n       x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme(legend.position = NULL, \n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = v_black))\n\n#volcano_map\n\n# ggsave(\n#   filename = here::here(\"final_images\", \"volcano_map.png\"),\n#   plot = volcano_map, \n#   device = \"png\",\n#   width = 8, \n#   height = 7,\n#   unit = \"in\"\n# )\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Bar Chart of Composite Volcano Rock Type\nThis figure is meant to answer the question: what type of rock are composite volcanoes made of?

    "text": "5 Design Elements\n\nGraphic Form + General DesignTextTheme + Color + TypographyMessage + ContextualizationAccessibilityDEI\n\n\nWhen brainstorming my design, all design elements centered around my conception of the map. I wanted the Ring of Fire to be fully visible with the Pacific Ocean centered, and text taking up the blank space in the middle. This allowed me to show the striking spatial clustering in this data, while also leaving me space to provide additioanl information and annotations.\nFrom there, I knew I needed to show how overwhelming amount of volcanoes that were made up andesite and formed in subduction zones. A mix of a bar chart created using gg_highlight and a donut chart with the same visual effect were perfect to emphaisize this point. I placed these below my map, and right below my last annotation in the Pacific Ocean, so the eye naturally gravitates towards them after fully reading the text.\n\n\nThe overall story of the infographic is provided by the text annotations. I wanted to create a series of questions in my walkthrough, and have the next figure help provide the answer. Additionally, since the topic is foreign to most of my viewers, I wanted to make sure I provided scientific background to terms people might not have heard before such as subduction or andesite. Each annotation is meant to be directly related to a graphic, and provide clear yet accessible context. For this reason, text on the actual graphs was kept incredibly minimal, to let the annotations speak for themselves.\n\n\nTo stay with the volcano theme, I chose a color palette that reminded me of different elements of volcanoes: grey for volcanic ash, black for obsidian formed by composite volcanoes, and my highlighting colors shades of red and orange for magma. While I likely could have added some fun flame text throughout the infographic, I wanted this to be something that could be sent to a teacher or used in a classroom, so I kept the design more professional and used the Roboto font throughout.\n\n\nThe overall message of this infographic is that composite volcanoes form in the Ring of Fire due to the unique tectonic setting of the region. Plain language and a minimal color scheme help provide a visually interesting but minimally technical graphic that can be understood by a mass audience.\nEach plot on the graph is meant to work together to contextualize the others. While the map alone or bar + donut plots alone could provide valuable information about composite volcanoes, together they showcase the broader overall trends and provide a more in-depth understanding. The captions support this partnership, providing a guiding narriative that keeps the viewer moving down the graphic.\n\n\nWhile my infographic does not specifically use a colorblind friendly palette, the majority of the graphic is black, white, and grey. All data is conveyed both with visual elements as well as color, so a completely colorblind viewer of the graphic would not be missing any information that a viewer with full color vision would have.\n\n\nFor this project, the goal was to make knowledge about composite volcanoes more accessible to a genral audience. While this does innately promote the inclusion element of DEI, the project does not view the data through a DEI lens. A future infographic could use this same data to see what populations could be most affected by volcanoes, especially at risk communities."

Each possible scenario, which ranges from overly pessimistic (high difficulty mitigating emissions) to overly optimistic (low difficulty mitigating emissions), will affect species to varying degrees. \n\n\nProblem\nClimate change and socioeconomic development will affect future environmental conditions and African lion range. We sought to understand the distribution of future suitable habitat for lions, considering two climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) to encompass a range of possible future conditions.\n\n\nApproach \nTo understand this problem, we utilized Maxent through the interactive web interface Wallace. Maxent utilizes species occurrence data input by the user as well as climate data (precipitation, temperature, etc.) to find the current range of suitable habitats for a specific species. It then allows the user to input a desired future timeframe and climate scenario to visualize changes in range over time. For this project, all other variables were held constant except the climate scenario (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) to compare the differences in suitable habitat accurately. Once the analysis was performed for each scenario, the original and future maps were exported as TIF files and input into ArcGIS Pro. Using Raster Calculator, the values of the future map were subtracted from the original to yield a layer describing the change in habitat suitability between the two. \n\n\nResults \nThe final analysis produced two maps (Figure 1) showing the percentage change for African Lion habitats between the two climate scenarios. Visual assessment provided the following results:\n\nWestern Africa was more suitable for African lions in SSP1-2.6 compared to SSP5-8.5\nSouthern Africa was more suitable for African Lions in SSP5-8.5 compared to SSP1-2.6\nRegions in Central Africa that became more suitable for African Lions in SSP1-2.6 became less suitable for lions in SSP5-8.5\n\n\nFigure 1. African lion habitat suitability. Percent change in habitat suitability for African lions (Panthera leo) from present day to 2041-60 under SSP1-2.6 (A-Sam Lance) and SSP5-8.5 (B-Liv Hemond).\n\n\nConclusion \nThe areas characterized by a negative change in habitat suitability values, shown in dark green on the map, should be prioritized for conservation. In effect, these areas are predicted to become increasingly suitable for lions in the future (henceforth these areas are referred to as “future suitable habitat”). It would be useful to compare the locations of future suitable habitat with existing nature reserves and protected areas to assess what degree of protection is already given to them, and whether there are key areas missing that would benefit from greater protections. Given the uncertainty over which SSP scenario will best match reality, managers may also want to prioritize conservation of future suitable habitat, especially where the areas overlap between the two SSP scenarios. \nIf lions shift their ranges to occupy new areas, it is worth considering the impact that may have on people living in those areas, especially if they are not accustomed to living near lions. While a charismatic and widely-regarded species, lions are also potentially dangerous to livestock and humans (Mills et al., 2023). To minimize human-wildlife conflict in a changing world, wildlife managers may want to consider proactively planning for human-lion coexistence in those communities based upon existing successful strategies (Blackburn et al., 2016).\n\n\nWorks Cited\nBlackburn, S., Hopcraft, J.

Studying Hydrology and Surface Processes, I was fascinated by rivers and how they could move sediments through landscapes. Looking for new experiences, I moved to New York City when I graduated and worked as a Staff Geologist, monitoring soil movement on construction sites to comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)\nCurrently I am a second-year student at the Bren School getting my Masters in Environmental Science and Management. Since coming to Bren, I have re-discovered my interest in rivers, and am currently working in the Surface Processes Lab here at UCSB studying river migration and movement worldwide. This results of this research could affect flood policy in regions that experience avulsion events, informing when flood prevention measures could be put into place.\nOutside of Bren, I love being outside, mainly walking along the beach with friends or going for a run around campus. I also enjoy knitting and crocheting, and host a craft night every week in my apartment."
