**ABOUT ME**

Hi, I'm Sam! I am currently living in Santa Barbara, California getting my Masters in Environmental Science and Management (MESM) degree.

**PROFESSIONAL INTERESTS:**

Geomorphology \| River Migration and Movement \| Flood Resilience \| Sustainable Water Resource Management \| Environmental Justice \| Sustainability

**TECHNICAL SKILLS:**
